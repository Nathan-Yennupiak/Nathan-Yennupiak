Glad to see you here!   
I am a full-stack software developer, and creative writer and graphic designer. I love finding solutions to problems, speaking and tutoring.

As a developer, I pay attention to details in order to find appropraaite solutions to solving problems and building new things. 
My Mantra is : Inspring People, transforming lives. When I'm away from my PC, I read books, write and listen to podcasts.
